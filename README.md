# Spam Detection ML
<p>Using Machine Learning we have designed spam detection. First, we will insert all necessary Libraries and insert the data, do preprocessing. To converting the raw document into a matrix we apply three processes they are tfidfvectorizer, countvectorizer and onehotencoder after applying We apply Naviye Bayes on It. </p>
